// C has four "Basic" data types...
/* 
"int" can only contain integral values
"float" is for floating point numbers
"double" is the same type as float but with twice the precision
"char" can be used for a single letter, the digit character '6', and ";" semi-colon....more on this later
"_Bool" is to store values 1 or 0 / true or false / yes or no


Any number,  char string, or character is a constant.
if an expression has a integer variable it wont be considered constant because the expression is bound to change

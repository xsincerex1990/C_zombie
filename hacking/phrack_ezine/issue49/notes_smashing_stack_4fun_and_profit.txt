Q: what is a stack?
A: A stack is a abstract data type frequently used is CS. Its a contiguos block of memory containing data. 
A stack of objects has the property that the last object placed on the stack will be the first object removed. (FILO)

Q: Why use a stack?
A: Modern-computers are built with high-level programming languages in mind.
the most important technique of structuring programs introduced by high level languages is the procedure or function. A procedure call alters the flow of control like jmp does but unlike a jmp it, when finished performing a task a function returns control to the statement or instruction following the call. this is done with the help of the stack.

The stack is also used to dynamically allocate the local variables used in
functions, to pass parameters to the functions, and to return values from the
function.

register SP points to top of the stack.
The bottom of stack is a fixed address. Its size is dynamically adjusted by the kernel at runtime. The CPU implements intructions to PUSH or POP of the stack.

TOP OF STACK IS THW LOWEST NUMERICAL ADDRESS.

 #define directive allows the definition of macros within your source code. These macro definitions allow constant values to be declared for use throughout your code. ... You generally use this syntax when creating constants that represent numbers, strings or expressions.



A  macro is a fragment of code which has been given a name. Whenever the name is used, it is replaced by the contents of the macro. There are two kinds of macros. They differ mostly in what they look like when they are used. Object-like macros resemble data objects when used, function-like macros resemble function calls.
